Laravel's query builder is a feature of the Laravel framework that provides a convenient and expressive way to interact with databases. It allows you to build and execute database queries using a fluent and chainable interface, making it easier to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from a database without writing raw SQL statements.


Here's an example to illustrate the simplicity and elegance of Laravel's query builder:

$users = DB::table('users')
            ->select('id', 'name', 'email')
            ->where('age', '>', 18)
            ->orderBy('name', 'asc')
            ->get();
